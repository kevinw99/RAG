develop a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that can answer questions based on a given set of documents.
The documents are provided in a directory.


        15 +  class DocumentType(Enum):
        16 +      """Supported document formats."""
        17 +      PDF = "pdf"
        18 +      DOCX = "docx"
        19 +      TXT = "txt"


1. why only 251 documents are ingested? isn't it total of 1,566 documents?
2. I don't see any .doc files getting ingested, why?

Can you research on these 2 topics, don't make code change
 1. Agentic RAG? what needs to be done to implement it from
2.  multi-source, multi-granularity RAG system that can:

   Answer high-level questions based on product requirements/specs

   Answer technical/developer-level questions based on the codebase

   Correlate requirements/specifications with actual implementation details
Input Example:
"Where is the spec-defined retry logic for payment failures implemented?"

Output Example:
"The retry logic is defined in Payment Handling Spec v3.1, section 4.2.2: 'Up to 3 retries in case of network failures.'

This is implemented in payments/retry_handler.py, class RetryPolicy, method execute_with_backoff().

Tests can be found in tests/payment/test_retry_policy.py."


 💡 Quick Start Options:

  Option 1: All-in-One Start
  python start_chat.py

  Option 2: Manual Start
  # Terminal 1 (if not already running)
  python start_server.py

  # Terminal 2
  streamlit run streamlit_chat.py

Another source of information is the confluence page. However our company use zscaler and Okta to manage access to
. Do you think we can have a crawler to crawl the confluence page even with zscaler and Okta in place?

Please do not run the crawler before I approve it.
Can you modify the code to show how many space
